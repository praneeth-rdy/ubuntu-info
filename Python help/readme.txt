** THIS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF JAVA, except that python doesn't require any HOME variable to set and the python versions are installed at '/usr/bin/' mostly with the names following '/usr/bin/python*' **

**********To change the default python version:

1)first install the python version you want to update to

2)By entering below code - you will see all the alternatives of python with priority orders(Higher number is given first priority by default)

praneeth@Praneeth-PC:~$ sudo update-alternatives --config python
There are 3 choices for the alternative python (providing /usr/bin/python).

  Selection    Path                Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/bin/python3.7   4         auto mode
  1            /usr/bin/python2.7   3         manual mode
  2            /usr/bin/python3.6   2         manual mode
  3            /usr/bin/python3.7   4         manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 

3)Then add the newly downloaded python version to the alternatives, by adding highest priority number at the end. higher the priority number => more the priority

Enter: sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/<path-to-python> <priority number you want to give it>

**************OTHER*************
1)Your terminal won't be opening if you have any issue with python or you have mistakenly deleted any python version.
However, you can open terminal again from file explorer.

2) Some python packages need to be installed using sudo apt install python3-<package name>
ex: 1) sudo apt install python3-opencv
    2) sudo apt install python3-tk
    3) sudo apt install python3-pip
